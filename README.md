# scriptsForBeccariEtAl2021

All the scripts needed to reproduce the NGS figures in Beccari et al. 2021 from raw data.

The 4Cseq, ChIP, and scRNAseq directories are independent.

The Hi-C_reanalysis_Yakushiji-Kaminatsui_data need to be done before Hi-C_fromValidPairsToCoolAndTADs.

The Plots need to be done after 4Cseq, ChIP and Hi-C_fromValidPairsToCoolAndTADs.

In the Plots/outputs, you can find the genomic figures before modification with illustrator.
In scRNAseq, you can find the UMAP used in the figures.
